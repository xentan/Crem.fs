# Crem.fs
  Just a silly word for a filesystem


The license chosen at the time, for the first commit, is arbitrarily chosen among those licenses that are considered for the project. The license will be chosen when the first source code is commited(the actual first commit, containing this README, and possible subsequent corrections or updates to the document, prior to the commit of the source code(possibly python code), is not considered "THE FIRST SOURCE CODE COMMIT" under any circumstances). And as such, the project, its founder(s) or companies associated with it; may not be held to the initial license ( APACHE ) if the license were to change upon the first commit of the program source code.

This document (README.md) may never be considered as the SOURCE, CODE, PROGRAM or PROGRAM SOURCE CODE. Even if someone were clever enough to make it successfully pass through an INTERPRETER or COMPILER. It's intention is to be a README. Never the program of the Crem.fs project.
